	Mandatory options :

-S [sequence]
	Nucleic acid sequence, mandatory. The sens of this sequence must be 5'-3'.


-C [complementary sequence]
	Nucleic acid complementary sequence, mandatory only if there is inosine bases or azobenznes in the sequence entered with the opton -S. The sens of this sequence must be 3'-5''.

-E [agent1=concentration1:agent2=concentration2]
	Different agent concentrations in the solution. The agents can be cations (Na, K, Tris, Mg for Na+, K+, Tris+ and Mg2+), dNTP or other agents (DMSO, formamide). The concentrations must be in Mol/L but there are some exceptions : DMSO is a percentage, formamide is a percentage if the method lincorr is chosen and in Mol/L if the method bla96 is chosen. At least one cation concentration is mandatory, the other agents are optional. See the documentation for the concentration limits. It depends on the used correction.

-P [nucleotide concentration]
	Concentration in mol/L of the nucleic acid strand in excess, mandatory.

-H [hybridization]
	Type of hybridization, mandatory. Four types of hybridization are allowed : dnadna (DNA duplex), rnarna (RNA duplex), dnarna or rnadna (hybrid DNA/RNA) and mrnarna or rnamrna (2-o-methyl RNA/ RNA). The type of hybridization defines the kind of the sequence and its complementary. 
		Ex : dnarna = the sequence (entered with the option -S) is a DNA sequence and its complementary (entered with the option -C) is a RNA sequence.
		Ex : rnadna = the sequence (entered with the option -S) is a RNA sequence and its complementary (entered with the option -C) is a DNA sequence  


	General options :

-v
	Switch ON the verbose mode, issuing lot more info. Default is OFF.

-T [threshold value]
	Threshold for approximative computation. Default is 60.

-nnpath [folder pathway]
	Change the default pathway (Data) where to find the default calorimetric tables (thermodynamic parameters).

-O [filename]
	To write the results in an output file. filename is the name or the pathway of the file.

-self
	To precise that the sequence entered with the option -S is self complementary. No complementary sequence is mandatory. The program automatically can detect a self complementary sequence for perfect matching sequences or sequences with dangling ends. In these cases, the option -self is not necessary, otherwise we need to precise that the sequences are self complementary.

-F [factor value]
	Correction for the concentration of nucleic acid. F is automatically 1 if the sequences are self complementary. Otherwise F is 4 if the both strands are present in equivalent amount and 1 if one strand is in excess. The default factor value is 4.

	Set of thermodynamic parameters and methods : 
By default, the approximative mode is used for oligonucleotides longer than 60 bases (the default threshold value), otherwise the nearest 
neighbor model is used.
